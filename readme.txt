This is the default sketch that comes with any new
Processing project in repl.it

Run it to confirm that when you move your mouse
within the sketch window that a circle of size
25 pixels appears, centered at the mouse position.

For this assignment, we would like you to fork the
project and apply the programming skills you have 
picked up so far in the course.

Instead of a circle of a fixed size that follows
the mouse cursor, we would like your program to show
a square of a random size centered on the mouse
cursor.

You are welcome to add any other exciting and
colorful additions if you have time
